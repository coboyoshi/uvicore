**The Async Python Framework for Artisans. An Elegant Fullstack Python Web, API and CLI Framework**


* Super fast, built on Starlette, FastAPI and other libraries.
* Equally well suited for complete CLI apps, Rest APIs with OpenAPI Docs and Traditional web applications.
* Fully asynchronous including CLI apps for unix socket programming and of course Websockets.
* Automatic API generation from all ORM models without a single line of View or Controller code.
* Full OpenAPI 3 automatically generated docs.
* Built for both web APIs and traditional server side rendered web applications.
* All apps are packages and all packages are apps.  A modular framework with app override capability for configs, templates, assets, routes, models and more.  Reuse your app inside other apps as libraries for a Python native micro service architecture.
* Custom IoC (Inversion of Control) system to swap any concrete implementation without changing imports.
* Custom fully asynchronous database layer and full ORM for MySQL, SQLite and Postgres supporting every relationship including polymorphism.
* Full python type hinting for IDE code intellisense across every module including ORMs with nested relations.
